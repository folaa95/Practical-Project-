# Practical-Project-
The website created is my take on a web design website which includes the services available and what the website is about along with many other things you may see on a web design website.
The lay out of the website is very simple with simple use of HTML and CSS. The website has heavy use HTML and CSS compared to the JavaScript at hand although this is so the JavaScript done is adequate. The responsiveness of the website could be considered adequate. Running the code through some test the CSS errors but these were very few.
Compared to the HTML there were mistakes, which could be considered common mistakes. The reason for why I have decided to this kind of website is becasue it is simple for me to do and to also measure my capability in HTML, CSS and Javascript coding.
