	<p>
       Founded in 2015 Web Designer is a small web design & development agency based in Brighton, UK. Over the last few years we've made a reputation for building websites that look great and are easy-to-use. 
      If you like what we do, and think we could work together, then get in touch or launch our project planner.

	<p class="dark">
	Every project is unique, but they all start with one thing in common. We want to know everything: where you started. Where you want to go next. What you value. Who your customers are and why they care about you. The only way to solve a problem is to understand it from every angle. Luckily, weâ€™ve got a proven process to quench our insatiable curiosity.
